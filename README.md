# Tropical
Welcome to Tropical!
Tropical is a terminal game made with Javascript & Node.js that mimics the game, Game. Tests where written used mocha, chai, & chai spies.

The goal of the game is to to match three of the same item (either horizontally or vertically) by swapping items. When there's a match, the matched items disappear and new items fall in from above to fill the gaps.

Let's say the game initially looks like this:
```
    游꼘  游볳  游꼡  游꼘  游볳  游본  游볳  游본  
    游꼡  游본  游본  游볳  游꼡  游볳  游본  游꼡  
    游본  游본  游꼡  游볳  游꼘  游꼘  游꼡  游본  
    游꼘  游볳  游본  游꼡  游꼡  游꼘  游볳  游본  
    游본  游꼘  游본  游꼡  游본  游꼡  游꼘  游꼡  
    游본  游꼘  游볳  游꼘  游볳  游꼘  游꼡  游꼡  
    游꼡  游본  游꼘  游볳  游본  游꼡  游꼡  游볳  
    游꼡  游꼡  游본  游꼘  游꼡  游꼘  游볳  游꼘
```

Let's focus on the upper left corner: 
```
    游꼘  游볳  游꼡
    游꼡  游본  游본
    游본  游본  游꼡
```


If we swap the `游본` with the `游꼡` below it, we'll get a match since there are three `游본` in a row.

Before Swap:               
```
    游꼘  游볳  游꼡             
    游꼡  游본  游본 <--         
    游본  游본  游꼡 <--     
```

After Swap: 
```
    游꼘  游볳  游꼡
    游꼡  游본  游꼡
--> 游본  游본  游본 <--
```

This will result in a few things happening:
1) The `游본`s will briefly turn into `救넖잺` & then disappear
2) The match will be added to the player's score
3) The `游꼡 游본 游꼡` will fall down to replace the row that used to be `游본 游본 游본`
4) Three new random items will fall down to replace the row that used to be `游꼡 游본 游꼡`
5) If in the process of steps 1-4, any new matches were created, 
   these matches will also disappear and be added to the player's score


## Running the game
1. Type `npm install` to install all packages
2. Run `node game.js` to run the game
3. Run `mocha` to run tests


## Screen API 
The Screen API was written by App Academy

### Initialize
* `Screen.initialize(numRows, numCols)` will initialize a grid with the given
  dimensions.
* `Screen.setGridlines(gridLines)` will insert lines between each grid element
  is `gridLines` is true, or hide them if `gridLines` is false.

### Commands
* `Screen.addCommand(key, description, action)` will add a command that calls
  the `action` callback anytime `key` is typed on the keyboard. `description`
  will be displayed in the help message.
* `Screen.printCommands()` will show a list of all loaded commands and their
  descriptions.

### Updating the grid
* `Screen.setGrid(row, col, char)` sets the character at `row` and `col` to
  the given `char`.
* `Screen.setTextColor(row, col, color)` sets the text color at `row` and
  `col` to the given `color`.
* `Screen.setBackgroundColor(row, col, color)` sets the background color at
  `row` and `col` to the given `color` (e.g. black, red, green, yellow, blue, cyan, white, magenta)

### Quitting
* `Screen.setQuitMessage(quitMessage)` sets a message to be printed when the
  user quits.
* `Screen.quit(showMessage=true)` quits the game and prints the message if
  `showMessage` is true.

### Rendering
* `Screen.render()` will update the display. This must be called anytime the
  grid or messages change.

### Displaying a message
* `Screen.setMessage(msg)` takes in a string to be printed below the grid each
  time it is rendered.
